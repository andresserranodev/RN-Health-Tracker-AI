## 📋 Overview [WIP]

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This application was developed with two primary goals in mind:

1.  **To learn and practice React Native:** It serves as a hands-on project to build skills in cross-platform mobile application development.
2.  **To test the Gemini API:** Specifically, this project explores the capabilities of the [**Gemini Image Understanding API**](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-understanding). The goal is to experiment with integrating this AI model for innovative health-related features, such as analyzing images of meals or medical readings.
