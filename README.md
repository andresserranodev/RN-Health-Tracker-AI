## 📋 Overview

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This application was developed with two primary goals in mind:

1.  **To learn and practice React Native:** It serves as a hands-on project to build skills in cross-platform mobile application development.
2.  **To test the Gemini API:** Specifically, this project explores the capabilities of the [**Gemini Image Understanding API**](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-understanding). The goal is to experiment with integrating this AI model for innovative health-related features, such as analyzing images of meals or medical readings.

## ✨ Key Features of the Board

- **Custom Views:** Different ways to view your data for clearer analysis.
- **Pre-defined Templates:** Easily create new health entries.
- **Integration and Flexibility:** Connect with other tools if needed and adapt the board to your specific needs.

## 🛠️ How to run it

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm or yarn
- Expo Go app on your mobile device

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    This project uses a `.env` file to manage environment variables like API keys. To get set up, copy the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Next, open the newly created `.env` file and add your personal Google Gemini API key in the as a EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY.

    Your `.env` file is already listed in `.gitignore` to ensure your keys are never committed to the repository.

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
